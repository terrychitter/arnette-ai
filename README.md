# Arnette AI
Arnette AI is a conversational/assist AI that makes use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to respond to users and their requests or commands.
**Note:** This project is still a work-in-progress and will not perform fully to the description.

## Installation and Configuration

### Poetry
1. Download or clone the repository into the directory of your choice.
2. If you do not already have poetry installed on your machine run `pip install poetry`
3. Install python dependencies using `poetry install --no-root`
4. Create a virtual python environment with poetry using `poetry shell`

### Ollama and Local LLMs
This project makes use of local LLMs (**Specifically Llama2**) to power Arnette AI. See the steps below to download and install your own LLM:
1. Download Ollama [here](https://ollama.com) if you have not already done so.
2. Once Ollama has been successfully installed. Open the terminal and run `ollama pull llama2`.
3. Once Llama2 has been successfully downloaded, navigate to the repository's root and run `ollama create crewai-llama2 -f ./setup/llama2_model_file`

### Environment Variables
Ensure that you have provided the correct environment variables and that you have renamed `.env.example` to `.env`. If you are also using the llama2 local LLM then your `.env` should be similar, if not, identical to the below snippet:
```
OPENAI_API_BASE='http://localhost:11434/v1'
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=crewai-llama2
OPENAI_API_KEY=NA
```
If you are using a different LLM then it is important to note that you should also update the `main.py` file.
```
# Initialize the Local LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="crewai-llama2", base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1")
```

## Run the project
To run the project simply run the main python file using the terminal: `python main.py`
